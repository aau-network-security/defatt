story-red: "Financially motivated adversary groups executing ransomware attacks have rightfully gotten our attention in recent years.
Similar to Lulzec, there's a new group catching attention with different motivations, targeting larger organizations.
Groups of this nature focus on data theft and extortion via means of social engineering - commonly, targeted spear phishing campaigns"
story-blue: "The LAPSUS$ group emerged onto the scene a number of months ago, targeting high-profile organizations such as Nvidia, Samsung, and Ubisoft - making various demands that in some cases, resulted in either data dumps or screenshots of internal systems shared via the group's Telegram account.
These were sometimes determined by user-voted polls within the group, suggesting that this is only the beginning of a series of attacks the group is undertaking more frequently as they gain press coverage."
