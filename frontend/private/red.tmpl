                      <p>You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Whatever can be captured in words can be conquered with understanding. You’ve been placed in the crucial moment. Abandon the shelter of insecurity. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. Don’t fucking censor yourself. Sterility leads to susceptibility. Intuition is fucking important. Defy fucking convention. If you don’t test your will against the dissent of the world, it can never grow stronger. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. You are not your fucking work.</p>
