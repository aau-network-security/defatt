# DefAtt - Defence and Attack Platform



## Purpose
The repository aims to construct a platform that is able to support Red Teams and Blue Teams 
to “fight” against each other in a closed and controlled virtual environment. 
The platform will be based on a high degree of automation, 
where specific (virtual) environments are created as needed to imitate real networks.


## Overview 
Stage of development makes it challenging to create a complete overview
of the architecture and therefore at the moment the following image 
can be used as a [reference architecture](http://cybertraining.dk/archNAP.png)
